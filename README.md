# Decentralized Autonomous Energy Grid

A blockchain-based smart grid system that enables autonomous management of energy production, consumption, and distribution through decentralized contracts.

## Overview

The Decentralized Autonomous Energy Grid (DAEG) is a next-generation energy management system that leverages blockchain technology to create a self-regulating, efficient, and transparent energy marketplace. The system optimizes energy distribution, encourages sustainable production, and enables real-time price adjustments based on market conditions.

## Core Components

### 1. Energy Production Contract
- Tracks energy generation from multiple sources:
    - Solar panels
    - Wind turbines
    - Hydroelectric plants
    - Traditional power plants
    - Microgrids
- Verifies and records production metrics
- Manages producer registration and certification
- Implements renewable energy incentives
- Monitors generation efficiency and maintenance schedules

### 2. Energy Consumption Contract
- Monitors real-time energy usage patterns
- Implements smart metering integration
- Provides consumption analytics and reporting
- Enables demand-response programs
- Manages consumer profiles and preferences
- Tracks carbon footprint metrics

### 3. Grid Balancing Contract
- Optimizes energy distribution across the network
- Manages energy storage systems
- Implements load balancing algorithms
- Handles peak demand management
- Coordinates microgrid integration
- Ensures grid stability and reliability
- Manages emergency response protocols

### 4. Dynamic Pricing Contract
- Adjusts energy prices in real-time based on:
    - Current supply levels
    - Demand patterns
    - Grid congestion
    - Weather conditions
    - Time of day
- Implements auction mechanisms
- Manages price discovery
- Handles settlement and payments
